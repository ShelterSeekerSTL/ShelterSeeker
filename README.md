# ShelterSeeker
App development for class

1. The purpose of this project is to provide an easier way for homeless people of St. Louis to gain shelter. It allows people within the community to take part in helping those in need. 

2. This is designed for people who would like to help the homeless find shelter as well as donating to surrounding shelters and learning the statistics about the homeless in that area. 

3. It will allow people to be able to help homeless people through a mobile device instead of stopping by the homeless person. This app will allow people to report homeless without having to leave their route or car. 

4. This group is the Shelter Seeker App, and we are a group of two people working on this app to better the community.
